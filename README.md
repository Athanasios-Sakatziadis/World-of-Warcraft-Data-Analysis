Since I’m a huge fan of Blizzard Entertainment, I wanted to bring my passion for World of Warcraft into data analysis by working with actual WoW data.

This project is based on the "WoW Avatar History" dataset from Kaggle (2008)—the most recent player data available.
To make this project as immersive and authentic as possible, I structured it like a real Blizzard support ticket, similar to the ones I’ve received over the years.
